## Starter Pack: Durable Repo Instructions (Java)
The Java starter pack lives in [`starter-pack/java/`](starter-pack/java/).
Copy the files in that folder into your repo root to adopt the Durable Repo Instructions.
The `.editorconfig` and PR template are universal, `AGENTS.md` provides agent guidance,
and `.cursor/rules.md` is Cursor-specific.
This repo is documentation-only, so there are no build commands to run here.
