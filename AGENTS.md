# AGENTS.md

This repository contains the **Discipline First** framework and starter-pack templates.

## Non-negotiables
- Do not delete or rename existing files unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer small diffs and focused commits.
- Keep templates generic and copy-paste friendly.
- Don’t invent build commands for this repo. If needed, state that it’s documentation-only.

## Workflow
1. Restate the goal in 3–5 bullets.
2. Propose a plan (max 5 steps).
3. Make the smallest change that satisfies the goal.
4. Update README/docs when you add new templates.
5. Summarize what changed and where the templates live.
