# Cursor Rules (Discipline First)

- Follow AGENTS.md in this repo.
- Ask clarifying questions if acceptance criteria is ambiguous.
- Do not change public APIs unless explicitly allowed.
- Prefer smallest diffs; avoid refactors unless tests are green.
- Always add/adjust tests for behavior changes (JUnit/Testcontainers/etc. as used here).
- Before major edits, show a short plan.
- After changes, provide: commands run, results, and verification steps.
